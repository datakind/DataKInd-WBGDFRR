# DataKind <> World Bank GDFRR
This is a repository for the materials generated by the DataKind volunteer team to explore the art of the possible for satellite imagery in disaster relief. 

The two primary outputs of this project are contained here.  First is the "writeup" in the write-up folder.  This is a broad literature review exploring the state of research, open source/open access databases, code snippets using keras, and resources for continued learning.  Second is a technical document explaining how image analysis and machine learning modeling could be developed for a specific geography and how to transform provided data (the Sri Lanka execution plan folder).  This process is generalizable and applicable to multiple geographies.
